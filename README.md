# Bash Scripting Practice and Automation Task 

## In this exercise, we used our knowledge of Bash scripting to work on two tasks. The first was to write a script that will prompt a user to input information, and then display a return message to the user based off their input. The second task was to automate a simple task on your machine using Bash scripting. 

## The biggest challenge that I faced during this exercise was realizing that after created the variable in the script to make a new directory in tast 2, I was not running the "mkdir" command with the variable created. So at first, the script was running successfully, but was not creating the new directory because there was no command being used. Once this was figured out, the script ran and executed perfectly.
